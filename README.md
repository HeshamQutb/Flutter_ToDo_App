# ToDo App
This is my first Flutter app, a simple ToDo app. It uses the following technologies:

Dart
Flutter
Sqflite
BLoC (Cubit)
The app allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks can be marked as completed or not completed.

Getting Started
To run the app, you will need to have Flutter installed. You can find the installation instructions here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

Once you have Flutter installed, you can clone this repository and open the project in your preferred IDE.
