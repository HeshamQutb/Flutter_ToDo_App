# ToDo App
This is my first Flutter app, a simple ToDo app, which showcases the implementation of various concepts learned during a course. It uses the following technologies:

* Dart
* Flutter
* Sqflite
* BLoC (Cubit)
* The app allows users to create and delete tasks. Tasks can be marked as completed or not completed.
